[Verse 1#1]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus 1#19]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2#27]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!

[Chorus 2#47]
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Drums Solo#57]

[Guitar Solo#77]

[Outro#87]
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
