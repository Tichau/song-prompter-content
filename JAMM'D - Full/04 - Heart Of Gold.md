[Intro]

[Verse 1#13]
I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold

[Chorus 1#21]
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Solo 1#27]

[Verse 2#35]
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold

[Chorus 2#43]
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Solo 2#49]

[Outro#56]
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
You keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
