[Verse 1#5]
You are the sun
You are the only one
My heart is blue
My heart is blue for you

[Chorus 1#13]
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen

[Verse 2#33]
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock and roll

[Chorus 2#41]
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen

[Verse 3#61]
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
It's all so rock and roll

[Chorus 3#77]
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
