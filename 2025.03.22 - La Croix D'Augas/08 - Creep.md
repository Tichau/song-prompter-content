[Verse 1#9]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

[Chorus 1#25]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2#33]
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

[Chorus 2#49]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

[Bridge#57]
She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

[Outro#73]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
```
