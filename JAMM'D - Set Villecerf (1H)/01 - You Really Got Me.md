[Verse 1#5]
Girl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Chorus 1#13]
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me

[Verse 2#25]
See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Chorus 2#33]
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
Oh no...

You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
