[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1#9]
You wanna know if I know why? I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye, or how one becomes two
And I just can't recall what started it all, or how to begin in the end
I ain't here to break it, just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

[Chorus#25]
I wanna make it, I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu

[Verse 2#33]
Sometimes the same is different, but mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life that jus' ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure is what I wanna do
Anytime, anywhere, and I say, babe

[Chorus#49]
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it, (Anytime, anywhere) I wanna make it wit chu
(Yeah)
I wanna make it, (Ooh-ooh) I wanna make it wit chu

[Guitar Solo#60]

[Chorus#73]
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it, (Anytime, anywhere) I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu
(Again and again and again and again and again) I wanna make it
```
