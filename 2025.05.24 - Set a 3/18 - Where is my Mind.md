[Verse 1#9]
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (Yeah)
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

[Chorus 1#15]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

[Verse 2#25]
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi

[Chorus 2#31]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

[Solo#41]

[Verse 1#44]
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

[Chorus#50]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

[Outro#60]
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
