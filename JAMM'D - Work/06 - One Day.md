[Verse 1#17]
One day it's here and then it's gone
How are you still holding on?
How are you still holding on?

You've felt this way for far too long
Waiting for a change to come
You know you're not the only one

[Chorus 1#33]
And life passes you by
Don't be wasting your time
On your own

[Verse 2#41]
You're always try to see yourself
Through the eyes of someone else
Through the eyes of someone else

Too shy to say that you need help
You and everybody else
You and everybody else

[Chorus 2#57]
Oh, life passes you by
Don't waste your time
On your own

Yeah life passes you by
Don't be wasting your time
All alone

[Bridge#65]
As your heart gets bigger
And you try to figure out
What's it all about

And your skin gets thicker
As you try to figure out
What's it all about

[Outro#90]
One day it's here and then it's gone
How are you still holding on?
How are you still holding on?
```
