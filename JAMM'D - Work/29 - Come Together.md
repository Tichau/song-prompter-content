[Verse 1#21]
Here come old flat top
He come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down
To his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what you please

[Verse 2#33]
He wear no shoe shine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say I know you
And you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together
Right now
Over me, yeah

[Solo#47]

[Verse 2#55]
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say
"One and one and one, is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see
Come together
Right now
Over me, yeah
Come together
Right now
Come together
Right now
Come together
Right now
Over me
