[Verse 1#5]
The sky is a neighborhood
So keep it down
heart is a storybook
A star burned out

The sky is a neighborhood
Don't make a sound
Lights coming up ahead
Don't look now

[Pre Chorus#13]
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't look now

[Chorus 1#17]
Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

[Verse 2#25]
Mind is a battlefield
All hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left
Whose side you're on?

Thoughts like a minefield
I'm a ticking bomb
Maybe you should watch your step
Don't get lost

[Pre Chorus#33]
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't get lost

[Chorus 2#37]
Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood

[Verse 3#48]
heart is a storybook
A star burned out
Something coming up ahead
Don't look now
 
[Chorus 3#53]
Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
 
Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

(The sky is a neighborhood) Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now
Gotta get to sleep somehow (The sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood
