[Intro 1#4]
So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot, then we can die
Ah-ah-ah
I know I won't be leaving here
With you

[Part 1#50]
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
I say, "You don't show"
Don't move, time is slow
I say
"Take me out

[Part 2#66]
I say, "You don't know"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you
To take me out

[Bridge#80]
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know, I won't be leaving here
With you

[Part 3#96]
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you
To take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on
Take me out

[Bridge#120]
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know, I won't be leaving here
With you
