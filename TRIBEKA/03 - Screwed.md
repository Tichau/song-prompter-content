[Verse 1]
Stuck in your web for a while
Loosin' my mind
Lack of judgement
Still intertwined

I'm free falling
Will it ever end?
Catch me later or never again

[Chorus 1]
I wanna wanna wanna love ya
Give you my soul
You wanna wanna screw me
Make me give up control
I wanna wanna wanna love ya
Give you my soul
You wanna wanna screw me
Make me give up control

[Verse 2]
High on seduction
Can't understand why you're teasin' me my friend
Stuck in this trip for a while
Please let me come down
Need to disappear
I gotta leave this town

[Chorus 2]
I wanna wanna love ya
Give you my soul
You wanna wanna screw me
Make me give up control
I wanna wanna love ya
Give you my soul
You wanna wanna screw me
Make me give up control

Make me give up control x8

I wanna wanna love ya
```
